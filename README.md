### Initial problem

A person can request up to 14 litres of water at a time.

A person can only request water in increments of 1 litre.

Only one of each cup size can be dispensed at a time (but a combination of smaller, and larger cups 

can be dispensed)

A cup can be partially filled.

The cheapest combination of cups must be chosen.

### Extended Kata

In order to extend this training with a TDD approach, 
as a team, we have added the additional test requirements 
that each cup used must be specified, 
along with the fill level for each cup used.
